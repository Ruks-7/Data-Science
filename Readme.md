## Project One: Student Performance Analysis

### Project Overview
This project analyzes student performance data across math, reading, and writing subjects to identify patterns, correlations, and performance gaps across different demographic groups.

### Dataset
The analysis uses the "StudentsPerformance.csv" dataset which includes:
- Test scores (math, reading, writing)
- Gender
- Race/ethnicity
- Parental level of education
- Lunch type (standard or free/reduced)
- Test preparation course completion

### Analysis Components
1. Basic Exploratory Analysis
2. Performance Analysis
3. Correlation Analysis
4. Performance prediction using Linear Regression

### Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

### Conclusion
This project aims to provide insights into student performance and identify key factors that influence academic success.
